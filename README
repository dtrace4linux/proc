"proc" is a colored top like utility which combines the features
of many other 'top'-like tools, but has more integrated features.
These include:

   * History - you can scroll backwards to see the state of the system
     at prior times.
   * More commands.
   * More detail on the commands.
   * Ability to see absolute or relative counter values.
   * Use of color.

When viewing the statistics screens, you may find it useful to
select "delta" mode if the statistics are monotonically increasing
counters. This makes it easier to spot which ones are changing and
how rapidly.

You can use the "clear" command to reset the onscreen counters to
make it easier to start a performance monitoring session or to just
watch, removing the noise from the history prior to the viewing session.

Header information
------------------
The header shows a number of fields, all incrementals from
the prior sample (typically 1s sample).

last pid:       Shows the last pid created. If this is jumping in big
                leaps then a fair amount of forking is going on. If
		the new processes are not visible in the ps listing, then
		it could be short lived processes (and %sys time
		will likely be higher to handle the expense of processing
		the forks/execs).

in:             Interrupts. High levels of interrupts could be due to
                I/O or network activity.

load avg:       1, 5 and 15 min load average.

Boot:           Time when system last booted.

(Reverse) HH:MM:SS
                When in rewind mode, the time of the sample (via
		Ctrl-B/Ctrl-F)

HH:MM:SS        Current time. Useful to watch in case no other activity.

CPU:            Summary of the CPU characteristics (from /proc/cpuinfo)
                If hyperthreading enabled, then "(HT)" will appear to
		show the number of cores may be doubled up.

proc:           Number of processes currently running or stopped or zombie.
thr:            Number of threads.

RAM:            Amount of memory in the system
RSS:            Amount of resident working set for processes
Free:           How much memory is free. Should be close to zero on a
                normal system. Kernel will try and use memory for process
		heaps or buffer cache. High free figure can indicate
		large processes have terminated, or large files have
		been deleted, or the memory hasnt been used since
		bootup.
Dirty:          How many dirty pages in memory which need to be committed to
                disk. High figure indicates active I/O. Can be high when
		doing large writes to slow devices (eg flash memory).
Swap:           How much swap space is in use.
Free:           How much swap space is available.


Absolute / Delta display mode
-----------------------------

Some commands simply show the pure data from /proc (eg meminfo and
vmstats). Many of these values are incrementing counters, and after a long
period of uptime, the number of digits is large enough that even
reading the numbers is hard work. Mentally determining what is
going on is equally difficult. For these reports, a delta is shown
next to the number to show if it is incrementing or decrementing
since the last display. 

To make it easier to read, a historical graph of recent activity is
shown (typically around 2mins of history).

The counters can be set to show absolute values or delta values.
Delta values can be useful to show the count by 'zeroing' the value
and watching the values rise.

In addition the values can be displayed as pure numbers or as
K/M/G to indicate thousands, millions, billions.

The commands to use are:

	* abs
	* delta
	* ranged
	* clear

Detailed command summary
------------------------
Process information
Network information
disk         Shows the details from /proc/diskstats. Graphs are shown
             for each numeric field. It may be better to use the 'delta'
	     mode, otherwise you will only see big numbers incrementing.

CPU	     Shows the details from /proc/cpuinfo and the current MHz
             speed of the cpu.

grep [!]expr Use this command to restrict the view to lines which match
             or (!) do not match the patern. At present, the pattern
	     is a literal match (no regexp support). Prefix the pattern
	     with "!" to do a negative match. The expression is used
	     to match columns, rather than specific lines. Not all
	     views support the feature.

meminfo	     Show /proc/meminfo. Only non-zero values are displayed.

netstat      Show current socket information. Additional details include
             the owning process (if it can be determined). Given
	     that a socket can be shared amongst processes, only one
	     process is shown (use lsof utility or examine /proc/pid/fd
	     to find the duplicate owners).

	     The display is a multiline display. The first line shows
	     the owner of the socket, the rcv/snd data queue, connection
	     state and local/remote address, in numeric format. Subsequent
	     lines show the local/remote address as names. If the owning
	     process can be determined, then the PID and process name is shown.

	     If no pid/command line is shown, then we are not running as root
	     and cannot determine the owner.

	     You can use the "grep" command to restrict the view to
	     matching lines or non-matching lines. (Prefix grep
	     pattern with "!", e.g. "grep !LISTEN").

	     If the socket is new (less than about 20s), then the owner
	     is displayed in reverse video.

Open files / cache usage
proc <pid>   Show details for a process, including /proc/pid/status,
             /proc/pid/stack and /proc/pid/syscall.

softirqs     Show /proc/softirqs. /proc/softirqs is used to indicate
             deferred interrupt level processing (which is painful to
	     SMP configurations). Instead the interrupt routine is
	     deferred until it can be enabled whilst other interrupts
	     can be allowed. Its normal to see these on a well running
	     kernel. Higher numbers indicate more interrupt processing,
	     but also better perceived performance.

vmstat       Show /proc/vmstat. There are lots of VM statistics and they
             vary from kernel to kernel. The absolute value and a delta
	     from the prior value are shown, along with a graph showing
	     recent history. You can change the display mode to
	     abs/delta mode and reset the counters.

"proc" includes 20 minutes of buffered history - you can cycle
back in time, to take a closer look at something which gained
your attention.

Other commands
--------------
grep [<pattern>]      Only show lines matching the pattern. Specify no
                      pattern to restore the full list.

History Mode
------------

Use the following keys to cycle through the history

<Ctrl-B>    Move back 1s of time
<Ctrl-F>    Move forward 1s of time
<Ctrl-R>    Reset to 'realtime'

Whilst in history mode, the realtime clock at the top right of the
screen will adjust to the appropriate time sample.

Type 'help' whilst running to see the interactive commands available.

Environment Variables
---------------------

PROC_MAX_SYMS      Number of shared memory symbol slots to reserve.
                   On later kernels, or kernels with lots of devices,
		   the default values may be too small, so you may want
		   to increase this, if "proc" complains of too few
		   values.
		   Default: 2048

PROC_MAX_TICKS     Number of history slots to reserve per symbol. The
                   amount of memory is directly proportional to this
		   number. Each number corresponds to 1s of history.
		   (1024 is rougly 20mins and about 300+MB of memory).

Files
-----
"proc" uses shared memory to communicate between the collector/monitor.
You will see 'procmon' in the process table for the collector. Only
one process will run for the system - the collector is shared amongst
the proc clients.

Files are stored in /tmp/proc (or $TMPDIR/proc is $TMPDIR is
defined).

Security Considerations
-----------------------
"proc" does not need to run as root, but some information may be
missing if it does not run as root. E.g. socket owning information
is one example.

Running proc as root, on your own system is perfectly reasonable, but
be careful of running as root on a public or limited access system.
proc can be used to kill process, spawn process, and writes to files
in the /tmp/proc directory.
